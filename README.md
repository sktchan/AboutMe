This is a project I made based off of the tutorial by ClearCode on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8ui5HK3oSiGXM2Pc2DahNu1xXBf7WQh-.
This small multi-levelled game tells you a little bit more about me through PyGame, almost like a fun-sized version of a resume!
You'll find a lot of free graphic assets I pulled from itch.io, specifically jumpbutton.itch.io, pixelfrog-assets.itch.io, and edermunizz.itch.io.
